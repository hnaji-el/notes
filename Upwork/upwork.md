1. We're going to research what the clients want
   - What are the terminologies that clients keep using for the jobs that you really want?
   - The exact words that clients use to describe what they want

   - What you want to do is when you're going through the jobs that are out there, you want to search a ton of different terms, and you want to write down the ones that just keep coming up in your space. We're talking unique words
   - Remember when you're doing this research, it is not about the work that you do. It's about the results that your clients get from it.


What do they want?
What are they frustrated by?
What are they tired of?
What is really their ultimate goal?
