1. React
  - React is a component-based library.

2. Component
  - A component is a bundle of markup, styles and logic that controls
    everything about a specific part of the UI.

3. Code organization
  - Instead of separating out application into markup (written in HTML),
    styles (written in CSS) and logic (written JavaScript),
    we organize our application into components.
  - It is a different mental model for code organization.

4. Mechanisms of reuse
  - With HTML, we have partials.
  - With CSS, we have classes.
  - With JavaScript, we have functions.
  - With React, we have components that bundle up all 3.

5. Application Structure
  [ index.js ]
  - It is responsible for rendering our React application, turning the React elements
    we write into live DOM nodes.
  - It includes setup tasks like import global CSS files, or set up any error-logging services.
  [ app.js ]
  - It manages core layout stuff.
  - It includes routes.
