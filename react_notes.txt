DOM: The live-running environment that displays the website


The truly magical thing about React is that we don't have to worry about keeping our state (held in JavaScript) and our UI (in the DOM?) in sync.

With React, we're describing what we want the UI to be, based on the current application state. React takes those descriptions and makes it real.

const element = React.createElement(
  'p',
  { id: 'hello' },
  'Hello World!'
);

{
  type: "p",
  key: null,
  ref: null,
  props: {
    id: 'hello',
    children: 'Hello World!',
  },
  _owner: null,
  _store: { validated: false }
}
